type Bike {
  id: ID!
  ownerName: String!
  type: String!
  make: String!
  serial: String!

```

### `Rentee`
```graphql
type Rentee {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  nationalIdNumber: String!
  phone: String!
  email: String!

  }) {
    id
    type
    ownerName
  }
}
```

### Delete a bike
```graphql
mutation {
  deleteBike(id: "bike-id")
}
```

### Add a new rentee
```graphql
mutation {
  addRentee(rentee: {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Smith",
    nationalIdNumber: "123456789",
    phone: "123-456-7890",

    heldBikes: []
  }) {
    id
    email

## üìò Notes

- Backend uses gRPC clients (`BikeClient`, `RenteeClient`) to perform actual data operations.
- Some queries like `getBike` are not yet implemented and may panic when called.
- `HeldBikes` refers to the IDs of bikes currently held by the rentee.
